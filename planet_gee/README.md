Very basic functions to get image ids from Planet and then download them to a Google Earth Engine account using Python instead of an application like Postman. I personally found it confusing to format the request, so this makes it a little easier/faster, hopefully...

You have to have gone through [the steps here](https://developers.planet.com/docs/integrations/gee/quickstart/) to give your GCP project GEE writing permissions first.
